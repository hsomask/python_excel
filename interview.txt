Q1. Tell me about yourself

Good morning/afternoon. I'm Zhimin Luo, excited to apply for your sofeware Engineer role. With 5 years of Java DevOps experience, I build robust backend systems under high-pressure environments.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Management from Guangdong Medical University and currently serve as a Java DevOps Engineer at Huaxin Yongdao, leading critical projects like the Shenzhen Housing Fund System.

My expertise includes designing RESTful APIs with Java/Spring Boot, optimizing database performance like improving SQL response by 67% in Oracle, and implementing CI/CD pipelines using Kubernetes and Shell scripts. I delivered key modules such as the 'Digital RMB Deposit' feature end-to-end, while proactively troubleshooting production issues through automated monitoring.

I thrive in Agile teams, recently developing standardized data interfaces for cross-functional collaboration in the Shenzhen Housing Fund project. With CET-6 English proficiency (518 points), I can communicate technical solutions effectively.

Your commitment to clean code and engineering innovation resonates with me. I'm confident my hands-on experience in microservices and system optimization will bring immediate value.  Thank you for this opportunity!

Q2 Why do you want to work for us?

I want to work for your company because not only do I believe this is a place I can develop and grow as a person, but it is also a place that is clearly driven towards being the best it can be within this sector.

The people I’ve spoken to who already work here had nothing but positive things to say about how the business is managed and how everyone is encouraged to be innovative and positive in their approach to their work. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3 Why do you want this job?
not only I want this job because the job description is a close match for my own skills, qualities and experience. 
We spend a lot of time at work, and I only want to work for a positive employer that supports its staff to help them do a great job. 

but also, I want this job because I feel in the long term, there will be opportunities for me to grow, develop and advance professionally within the company.

Q4 Tell me about a time when you were under pressure at work. What was the situation, and how did you get through?
//Tell me about a time you took the initiative to solve a difficult problem.

Last Friday morning during peak transaction hours—just after our major system upgrade—the Shenzhen Housing Fund platform crashed due to a database connection pool exhaustion triggered by the new code. As the incident commander, I pinpointed the leak within 30 minutes by analyzing WebLogic thread dumps and K8s pod logs, then coordinated an emergency rollback with DevOps and DBA teams via Git version tagging. We restored full functionality in 60 minutes with zero data loss, while I simultaneously pushed real-time outage updates to 20+ stakeholders via Slack. Post-recovery, I led a root-cause analysis that revealed missing connection release logic in the update, and we now enforce automated pool stress tests in pre-release pipelines.

Q5  What did you like and dislike about your last job? 

There were many things I liked such as the team I was a part of and how we all pulled together to get things done during tasks and projects.
The only thing that frustrates me about my last job is that I feel like I can't make any progress in this company.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q6 what are your strengths

I think my strengths are that I can handle pressure and handle problems patiently. For example, when faced with production problems, I can calm down and troubleshoot the problems, and then come up with solutions.

and  my ability to learn things very quickly and to work alone, unsupervised to a high standard. My strong communication skills and how I am a people- person are also other strengths.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q7 what are your shortcomings

Occasionally, my attention to detail slips in complex coding scenarios, which might introduce minor defects. To mitigate this, I’ve built some safety net: mandatory unit/integration testing, peer review before commit,and proactive logging for critical paths – this reduces escapes by 90% based on my last project metrics.


Q8 Why should we hire you?
You should hire me because having studied the job description and the requirements of the role, I can come into the position and quickly ADD VALUE.

I am a fast learner, which means you wont't have to spend your valuable time and effort training me up and supervising me for weeks on end. 


Q9 Describe yourself in three words.
I consider myself to be a loyal, motivated and optimistic person.
Being a loyal employee means you can trust me to do a good job and to always be a good role model for your company.
Being self-motivated means, you will never have to pick me up for not doing my job properly either on time or to the necessary standard.
Being optimistic means I approach challenges with a solutions-focused mindset, and my positive attitude helps maintain team morale during high-pressure projects.


Q10  What are your salary expectations?

I believe I am worth the highest salary amount due to my track record and my experience. However, I do appreciate you do not know me, and I have a responsibility to prove to you my worth t

Therefore, I would be happy with a salary of  17000 and I believe you would be getting great value for money by hiring me at that amount. so all you would need to do is carry out your research and change those two figures the lower range and the higher range.

Q11
Do you have any questions for us?
1)Could you share how the team balances speed and quality in practice? For example, what’s your typical approach when facing tight deadlines while ensuring SOLID principles and test coverage aren’t compromised?
2)I noticed this role involves cross-global collaboration. How do team members across time zones usually stay aligned on priorities, especially during critical phases like production releases or incident resolution?
